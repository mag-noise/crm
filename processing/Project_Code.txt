This folder contains the code that was used to generate the data. Users can manipulate the code/data and modify for their own applications.

The files included:

l1_processing.m
    This MATLAB script processes level 0 data from multiple magnetometer sensors onboard 
	a spacecraft. It performs near-DC data processing, interference data processing, and 
	geophysical data processing. Each section of the script follows a similar pattern of 
	getting each individual measurement of the magnetometers in the x, y, and z direction, 
	filtering to remove the near-DC trend, truncated to remove edge artifacts, and 
	reformatted into matrices. Time series and frequency plots are generated to confirm the processing. 

l2_processing.m
   This MATLAB script processes Level 2 data for a specific application. 
   	It combines data from multiple sources, including trend, interference, and geophysical data,
   	to generate Level 2 data products. The script performs data manipulation, combination, 
  	 and visualization, including generating time series and frequency domain quicklooks.

combine_measurements.m
   This script combines measurements from different sources, applies necessary
   	processing steps such as filtering and detrending, and saves the processed
   	data to a MAT file.

uniform_detrend.m
    This function applies uniform detrending to a signal. It subtracts the 
   	 moving average of the signal from the signal itself.

read_tsv.m
    This function reads data from a TSV file containing magnetic field
    	components recorded by multiple sensors. It extracts the X, Y, and Z
    	components for each sensor and returns them as matrices. Optionally, it
    	can display plots of the extracted data.
